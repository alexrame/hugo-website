This post contains the notes taken from reading of the following paper:

- [Efficient Graph-Based Segmentation](https://cs.brown.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf)
by [Pedro Felzenszwalb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k1hJzF0AAAAJ&hl=en)
and [Daniel Huttenlocher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q16KVs0AAAAJ&hl=en).

I was also helped by the slides of Stanford's [CS231b](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231b_spring1415/slides/ranjay_pres.pdf).

**Fast-RCNN** was the state-of-the-art algorithm for object detection in 2015; its
object proposal used **Selective Search** that itself used **Efficient Graph-Based
Segmentation**.

The reason this segmentation was still very useful almost 10 years later is
because the algorithm is fast, while remaining quite efficient.
Its goal is to make a segmentation of various objects in an image.

# A Graph-Based Algorithm

The algorithm sees an image as a graph, and every pixels as vertices. Making of
good segmentation for an image is thus equivalent to finding communities in a
graph.

What separates two communities of pixels is a boundary based on where similarity
ends and dissimilarity begins. A segmentation **too fine** would result in
communities separated without real boundary between them; in a segmentation
**too coarse** communities should be splitted.

![Too fine vs too coarse segmentation](/figures/too_fine_coarse.svg)

The authors of the papers argue that their algorithm always find the right
segmentation, neither too fine nor too coarse.

# Predicate Of A Boundary

The authors define their algorithm with a **predicate** $D$ that measures
dissimilarity: That predicate takes two components and returns true if a boundary
exists between them. A component is a segmentation of one or more
vertice.

With $C1$ and $C2$ two components:

$$
D(C1, C2) = \begin{cases}
    true    & \text{if } \text{Dif}(C1, C2) > \text{MInt}(C1, C2)\newline
    false   & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

With:

$$\text{Dif}(C1, C2) = \min\_{\substack{v\_i \in C1, v\_j \in C2 \newline (v\_i, v\_j) \in E\_{ij}}} w(v\_i, v\_j)$$

The function $Dif(C1, C2)$ returns the minimum **weight** $w(.)$ edge that
connects a vertice $v\_i$ to $v\_j$, each of them being in two different
components. $E\_{ij}$ is the set of edges connecting two vertices between components
$C1$ and $C2$. This function $Dif$ measures the **difference between two components**.

And with:

$$\text{MInt}(C1, C2) = min (\text{Int}(C1) + \tau(C1), \text{Int}(C2) + \tau(C2))$$

$$\tau\(C\) = \frac{k}{|C|}$$

$$\text{Int}\(C\) = \max_{\substack{e \in \text{MST}(C, E)}} w(e)$$

The function $\text{Int}\(C\)$ returns the edge with maximum weight that connects two
vertices in the [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
(*MST*) of a same component. Looking only in the MST reduces considerably the
number of possible edges to consider: A spanning tree has $n - 1$ edges instead
of the $\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$ total edges. Moreover, using the *minimum*
spanning tree and not just a common spanning tree allows to have segmentation
with high-variability (but still progressive). This function $\text{Int}$ measures the
**internal difference of a component**. A low $\text{Int}$ means that the component
is homogeneous.

The function $\tau\(C\)$ is a threshold function, that **imposes a stronger
evidence of boundary for small components**. A large $k$ creates a segmentation
with large components. The authors set $k = 300$ for wide images, and $k = 150$
for detailed images.

Finally $\text{MInt}(C1, C2)$ is the **minimum of internal difference of two
components**.

To summarize the predicate $D$: A large difference between two internally
homogeneous components is evidence of a boundary between them. However, if the
two components are internally very heterogeneous it would be harder to prove
a boundary. **Therefore *details* are ignored in high-variability regions but
are preserved in low-variability regions**:

*Notice how the highly-variable grass is correctly segmented while details like
numbers on the back of the first player are preserved.*

# Different Weight Functions

The predicate uses a function $w(v_i, v_j)$ that measures the edge's weight
between two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$.

The authors provide two alternatives for this weight function:

## Grid Graph Weight

To correctly use this weight function, the authors smooth the image using a
[Gaussian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) with $\sigma = 0.8$.

The Grid Graph Weight function is:

$$w(v_j, v_i) = |I(p_i) - I(p_j)|$$

It is the intensity's difference of the pixel neighbourhood. Indeed, the authors
choose to not only use the pixel intensity, but also its 8 neighbours.

![The eight neighbours](/figures/gridgraph_weight.svg)
*The intensity is the pixel-value of the central pixel $p_i$ and its 8
neighbours.*

Using this weight function, they run the algorithm three times (for *red*, *blue*,
and *green*) and choose the intersection of the three segmentations as result.

## Nearest Neighbours Graph Weight

The second weight function is based on the [Approximate Nearest Neighbours Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximate_nearest_neighbor).

It tries to find a good approximation of what could be the *closest* pixel. The
features space is both the spatial coordinates and the pixel's RGB.

Features Space = $(x, y, r, g, b)$.

# The Actual Algorithm

Now that every sub-function of the algorithm has been defined, let's see the
actual algorithm:

For the Graph $G = (V, E)$ composed of the vertices $V$ and the edges $E$,
and a segmentation $S = (C_1, C_2, ...)$:


0. Sort E into $\pi$ = ($o_1$, ..., $o_m$) by increasing edge weight order.
1. Each vertice is alone in its own component. This is the initial segmentation
$S^0$.
2. For $q = 1, ..., m$:
    - Current segmentation is $S^q$
    - ($v_i$, $v_j$) $= o_q$
    - If $v_i$ and $v_j$ are not in the same component, *and* the predicate
      $D(C_i^{q - 1}, C_j^{q - 1})$ is false then:
        - Merge $C_i$ and $C_j$ into a single component.
3. Return $S^m$.

The superscript $q$ in $S^q$ or $C_x^Q$ simply denotes a version of
the segmentation or of the component at the instant $q$ of the algorithm.

Basically what the algorithm is doing is a bottom-up merging of at first
individual pixels into larger and larger components. At the end, the segmentation
$S^m$ will neither be too fine nor too coarse.

# Conclusion

As you have seen, the algorithm of this paper is quite simple. What makes it
very efficient is the various metrics and the predicate defined beforehand.
