# About me

Soaked with many Sci-Fi books & movies, I am deeply passionate about
Artificial Intelligence. I had a strong formation in Computer Science in the
*grande école d'ingénieur* EPITA. During my time there I was also lucky to teach
several courses as a Teacher Assistant. I am now specializing in Deep Learning
for Computer Vision.
